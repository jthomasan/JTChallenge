# Coding Challenge - Solution


## Overview

This is an effort to resolve the conding challenge provided. As instructed, this is a single page application developed using React and Redux. Since, it was mentioned not to use 
any style libraries, I have not used bootstrap for responsiveness. Instead, I have developed my own css utilizing the flex css property. It s not massively tested for optimisation though.
